# Word Frequency

This word frequency app allows you to record your voice and then creat a table to show the frequency of each word you use. This app was originally developed because I wanted to use it to help me learn foreign languages. I learned about the concept that those who know 1,000 to 3,000 words can carry on everyday conversations. Knowing 4,000 to 10,000 words makes people advanced language users while knowing more than 10,000 words puts them at the fluent or native-speaker levels. Very often you will find lists of the most frequently used words in a langue. However, many of those words might not be very useful to you personally. Therefore, by creating this app, you can record yourself speaking and find out what words you use the most.
